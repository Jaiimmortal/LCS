# LCS
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences). It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The longest common subsequence problem is a classic computer science problem, and has applications in [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics).
This algorithm focuses on avoiding the overlapping i.e., avoid calculating the subsequence that has already been generated.
Use Python 2.7 (while entering the string, enter them in quotes :P)
This algorithm, printing the Longest Common Subsequence problem falls under Dynammic programming and has been implemented two compare two DNA strands.
Random DNA sequences can be generated [here](http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~mmaduro/random.htm)
